# ✅ Call Archival Implementation - COMPLETE

## 🎉 What Was Implemented

Your Aurora system now **automatically archives completed calls to Firestore** and **removes them from active calls** - exactly following the Firebase Database Structure schema!

---

## ✅ Implementation Summary

### **When a Call Ends:**

1. ✅ **Call archived to Firestore `calls/` collection**
   - All fields follow schema exactly
   - Includes duration, urgency, status, etc.
   
2. ✅ **Conversation archived to Firestore `conversations/` collection**
   - Messages in array format
   - Follows schema exactly
   
3. ✅ **Removed from Firebase Realtime Database**
   - Deleted from `active_calls/{call_id}`
   - Deleted from `active_conversations/{conv_id}`
   
4. ✅ **All operations are asynchronous**
   - No blocking or delays
   - Background threads handle archival

---

## 🔧 Code Changes Made

### **Modified Methods:**

1. **`end_call(call_id)`** - Enhanced
   - Now triggers archival to Firestore
   - Removes from Firebase Realtime DB
   - All async (background thread)

2. **`_archive_call_to_firestore()`** - NEW
   - Archives to Firestore `calls/` collection
   - Follows schema exactly
   - Calculates duration automatically

3. **`_archive_conversation_to_firestore()`** - NEW
   - Archives to Firestore `conversations/` collection
   - Follows schema exactly
   - Messages in array format

4. **`find_active_call_by_phone()`** - NEW
   - Helper to find call_id from phone number
   - Used by Twilio callbacks

### **Updated Endpoints:**

1. **POST `/call-status`** - Enhanced
   - Now archives call when Twilio reports completion
   - Finds call by phone number
   - Triggers archival

2. **POST `/hangup`** - Enhanced
   - Archives call on explicit hangup
   - Triggers cleanup

3. **POST `/api/call/{call_id}/end`** - Already works
   - Existing endpoint now triggers archival

## 📊 Firestore Schema Compliance

### ✅ `calls/` Collection - 100% Compliant

```javascript
{
  worker_id: "string",              ✅
  mobile_no: "string",              ✅
  conversation_id: "string",        ✅
  urgency: "CRITICAL|URGENT|NORMAL", ✅
  status: "COMPLETE",               ✅
  timestamp: SERVER_TIMESTAMP,      ✅
  medium: "Text" | "Voice",         ✅
  final_action: null,               ✅
  admin_id: "string" or null,       ✅
  resolved_at: SERVER_TIMESTAMP,    ✅
  duration_seconds: number,         ✅
  admin_notes: ""                   ✅
}
```

### ✅ `conversations/` Collection - 100% Compliant

```javascript
{
  call_id: "string",                ✅
  messages: [                       ✅
    {
      role: "user|assistant",       ✅
      content: "string",            ✅
      timestamp: "string"           ✅
    }
  ],
  archived_at: SERVER_TIMESTAMP,    ✅
  total_messages: number            ✅
}
```

**Nothing added outside the schema!** ✅

## 🧪 How to Test

### Test 1: Make a Call and Let It Complete

```bash
# 1. Start server
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000

# 2. Make test call
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/process-speech \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"speech": "Hello Aurora", "ph_no": "+1234567890"}'

# 3. End the call
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/call/{call_id}/end
```

### Test 2: Check Logs

```bash
# Look for these messages:
✅ "📦 Call {call_id} archived to Firestore calls/ collection"
✅ "💬 Conversation {conv_id} archived to Firestore conversations/ collection"
✅ "✅ Call {call_id} archived to Firestore and removed from active calls"
```

### Test 3: Verify Firestore

1. Open Firebase Console
2. Navigate to **Firestore Database**
3. Check **`calls/`** collection → Should see your call
4. Check **`conversations/`** collection → Should see messages

### Test 4: Verify Cleanup

1. Navigate to **Realtime Database**
2. Check **`active_calls/`** → Call should be REMOVED ✅
3. Check **`active_conversations/`** → Conversation should be REMOVED ✅

---

## 📋 Verification Checklist

After a call ends:

- [ ] Log shows "Call archived to Firestore"
- [ ] Firestore `calls/` has the call document
- [ ] Firestore `conversations/` has the conversation
- [ ] Firebase Realtime `active_calls/` no longer has the call
- [ ] Firebase Realtime `active_conversations/` no longer has conversation
- [ ] All Firestore fields match schema
- [ ] No errors in logs
- [ ] Admin dashboard no longer shows call as active
